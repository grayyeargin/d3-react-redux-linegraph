# React + Redux Scaffold
A starter kit for projects using [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)  

### Getting Started
Clone this repo, install the dependencies, and get the local serving running with the following steps:
```
1. git clone https://github.com/grayyeargin/react-redux-starter my-react-redux
2. cd my-react-redux
3. npm install
4. npm start
```

This will set up a local dev server at http://localhost:3000

### Building for Production
This includes a [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) production config file to help build production ready assets. To do this run:
```
npm run build
```
This will build your main minified javascript and css files in the static folder.
